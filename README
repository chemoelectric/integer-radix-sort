Integer-keyed stable radix sort for C
-------------------------------------

This sort tends to much faster than qsort(3), and is stable. However,
the keys must belong to one of the C compiler’s integer types.

The ‘radix’ for the sort is 256. In other words, the sorting is done
one byte position at a time.

This package is a translation into C macros of a similar sort I wrote
as ATS2 template functions.
